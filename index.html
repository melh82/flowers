            <hr>
        
        <p class="lora">When choosing your flowers consider that each plant grows differently. Also consider the features of your garden - is it shaded or sunny? What is the quality of your soil? Is it sandy or does it contain lots of clay?</p>
        
        <p class="lora">You will easily find flowers for a sunny garden but it will be more difficult to find flowers for shaded gardens. A few flowers that can grow in some shade are violas, pansies, impatiens and primroses.</p>

            <hr>
        
        
        <p class="lora">Good soil is essential. Dig the soil before planting your flowers. Remove the weeds and rocks.</p>

            <hr>
        
        
        <p class="lora">Dig a tiny hole in the soil and plant your seeds. Cover with soil and water gently.  It's important to keep the spot well watered.</p>

            <hr>
          
        
        <p class="lora">For perennials, add 2 inches of mulch each year, right to the plant's crown to help it retain the moisture.</p>
        
        <p class="lora">Watering should be done according to the garden features and the plant features, as some flowers need more water, while others do not need as much.</p>

            <hr>
        
        
        
        <p class="lora">Annuals go through their whole life cycle in one growing season: sprouting from a seed, growing leaves and roots, producing flowers, creating seeds and then dying.</p>
        
        <p class="lora">Perennials are plants whose root systems stay alive underground for several years or even decades. The part above the soil may go dormant and die back in winter, but the plant is still alive and will sprout again in spring.</p>
